# Smart Contract Hacking Project

This project demonstrates how we can write both a smart contract and deploy scripts using hardhat and ethers.js to hack another contract on the blockchain. See both SmartContractAttacker2.sol and deploy.js (in scripts folder). Note the various methods used to deposit into the account, retreive the balance, and call the necessary functions on the contract. 

```
npx hardhat node
npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.js
```
