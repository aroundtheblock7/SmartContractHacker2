# Smart Contract Hacking Project

This project demonstrates how we can write both a smart contract and deploy scripts using hardhat and ethers.js to hack another contract on the blockchain. See both SmartContractAttacker2.sol and deploy.js (in scripts folder).

``
npx hardhat node
npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.js
npx hardhat test
```
